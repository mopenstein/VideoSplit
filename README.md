# VideoSplit
C# front end for FFMPEG that normalizes audio, finds commercial breaks, splits, and other useful things for running a tv station.

Outputs 640x480 for SD tv viewing. Companion application for my automated raspberry pi SD tv station: https://github.com/mopenstein/raspberry_pi_tv_station
